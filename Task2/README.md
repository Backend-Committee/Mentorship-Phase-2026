# Task2: Authentication System

## Overview
This project implements a simple authentication system that allows users to register, log in, and manage their accounts. The system is implemented in Python and includes the following key components:

- **Auth_System.py**: Handles user authentication logic, including registration and login.
- **User.py**: Manages user-related data and operations.
- **users.json**: Stores user data in JSON format.
- **main.py**: Provides a command-line interface for interacting with the authentication system.

## Features
1. **Register User**: Allows new users to register by providing a username, email, and password.
2. **Login User**: Authenticates existing users using their email and password.
3. **Email Validation**: Ensures that the email provided during registration is valid.

## File Descriptions
- **main.py**: Contains the main menu and user interface logic.
- **Auth_System.py**: Implements the authentication system, including methods for registering and logging in users.
- **User.py**: Defines the user model and handles user data operations.
- **users.json**: A JSON file used to persist user data.

## Future Improvements
- Add password encryption for enhanced security.
- Implement a graphical user interface (GUI).
