          "\"Cranford\" by Elizabeth Cleghorn Gaskell is a novel written in the mid-19th century. The story unfolds in a small English village dominated by women, where men are conspicuously absent from social life. The narrative is rich with observations about the peculiar rituals, customs, and dynamics of the tight-knit community, primarily focusing on the lives of its female inhabitants, including the amiable and kind-hearted Miss Matty and the spirited Captain Brown, who disrupts their tranquil existence.  At the start of \"Cranford,\" we are introduced to the unique social structure of the village, characterized by its predominantly female residents who manage their affairs without the presence of men, aside from the occasional visitor. The opening chapter humorously details the societal norms and the unspoken rules that govern interactions, such as visiting etiquette and the preference for economy over ostentation. Key characters like the gentle Miss Matty and the charismatic Captain Brown are introduced, hinting at a deeper exploration of human relationships and character development as the story progresses. Through the eyes of the narrator, the reader gets a glimpse into the endearing quirks and camaraderie of the Cranford community, setting the stage for the unfolding tales of friendship, love, and social commentary that define this charming novel.

          "\"A Room with a View\" by E. M. Forster is a novel written during the early 20th century, which explores themes of social conventions and personal freedom. Set primarily in Italy and England, the narrative follows the journey of Lucy Honeychurch, a young woman navigating her feelings about love, societal expectations, and her own desires against the backdrop of her experiences abroad.  The opening of the story introduces the character of Lucy and her cousin Charlotte Bartlett as they arrive at the Pension Bertolini in Florence. Disappointed by the accommodation\u2019s lack of a promised view, they bicker about their arrangements. Lucy's eagerness to experience Italy conflicts with Charlotte's more cautious demeanor. Here, the reader meets Mr. Emerson and his son George, who challenge the norms of polite society, offering their rooms to Lucy and Charlotte out of kindness, which Charlotte initially declines. The tension between personal desires and societal expectations is palpable, setting the stage for Lucy's internal conflict and her eventual blossoming into independence and self-discovery.
